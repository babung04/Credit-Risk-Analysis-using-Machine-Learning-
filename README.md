# Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning
Approving loans without proper scientific evaluation increases the risk of default. This can lead to bankruptcy of lending agencies and consequently the destabilization of the banking system. This is what happened in the 2008 financial crisis which affected the world economy adversely. Three components decide the amount of loss that a firm faces as a result of loan default:

* Probability of Default (PD)
* Exposure at Default (EAD)
* Loss given Default (LGD)
The expected loss (E-Loss) is the simple product of these three quantities:

ELoss=PD⋅EAD⋅LGD

Our focus here is on the Probability of Default (PD). Here, we will look at the example of German Credit data which is taken from the Kaggle database.
